## 💡 Tips for Better Performance

### Before Publishing

1. **Publish on Tuesday-Thursday** (best engagement)
2. **Publish at 7-9 AM or 12-2 PM** (your audience's timezone)
3. **Avoid weekends** (lower engagement generally)

### During Publishing

1. **Use all 5 tags** (maximum discoverability)
2. **Choose "Distribute to Medium"** (more reach)
3. **Enable social sharing** (immediate promotion)

### After Publishing

1. **Share within first hour** (Medium algorithm boost)
2. **Respond quickly to comments** (shows you're active)
3. **Share multiple times** (different audiences see it)
4. **Cross-post after 1-2 weeks** (Dev.to, Hashnode, etc.)

- ❌ **Forgetting cover image** → Required for good first impression
- ❌ **No tags** → Article won't be discovered
- ❌ **Not sharing** → Even great content needs promotion
- ❌ **Ignoring comments** → Engagement matters for algorithm
- ❌ **Expecting instant success** → Takes time to build audience
- ❌ **Comparing to viral posts** → Most articles don't go viral (and that's OK)
- ❌ **Perfect formatting** → Done is better than perfect
